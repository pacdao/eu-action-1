Thanks for your support in getting PAC DAO launched!  If you own any of our existing NFTs, you can mint one of our bonus NFTs per token you have a balance for, absolutely free (plus cost of gas).

In other words... if you have 10000 gov tokens you get to mint 1 Bonus NFT.  If you have 1 gov token and 1 founder token, when you mint you will get 2 Bonus NFTs.

If you end up losing your balance for any of these tokens after you mint, due to refund or transfer, you still get to keep your bonus NFTs!  Something to keep in mind for users who are considering the refund window for Action NFT1

Each address is permitted to mint exactly once, so you may want to try to collect as many of our NFTs as possible before minting.  Once the address has minted it can never mint again.  If you acquire additional eligible NFTs after the fact, you get no additional bonus tokens.  Users who are set to receive a token from an unfinished auction, for example, Action NFT Rare, may wish to wait until the auction conculdes.

PAC governanace retains the right to add additional eligible tokens, or to disable minting, at any time by a vote of governance token holders.  The PAC governance address also allows to retroactively set different URLs for these tokens, in case we wish to update these after the fact.

The token has no frontend.  To claim visit the Etherscan page, connect your wallet, and click the "mint" button.

Function calls which may be useful include:
 * `tokenAddrs`: All current tokens authorized with the mint.
 * `hasMinted`: Has the address minted already?
 * `userCap`: How many tokens the address would receive upon minting.
 * `mint`: Mint your tokens!

Together we can support crypto activism!
