Inspired by our successful [SEC Letter Writing campaign](https://pac.xyz/#/sec-action), PAC DAO is announcing a similar campaign targeted at users who help EU citizens organize and respectfully comment to Parliament.

# Developer Notes

This NFT is itself historic.  Due to differences in byte types, no prior ERC-721 coded in Vyper was compatible or successfully indexed by OpenSea.  Since the release of the Vyper 0.3.2, Vyper became fully compatible.  This NFT is therefore the first known NFT to be available on OpenSea.

NFTs coded in Vyper have significant advantages, including gas savings.  Even with full ERC721-Enumerable compatibility, the gas price of this mint is lower than any known Solidity NFT.

The [contract/VyperNFT.vy](https://github.com/pacdao/eu-action-1/blob/main/contracts/VyperNFT.vy) file in this repository extends the functionality of the [Vyper NFT Example](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/master/examples/tokens/ERC721.vy) with ERC721-Enumerable compatibility.  This file may be modified and used by any parties wishing to generate their own Vyper NFT with its efficiency.  The [contract/EUMinter.vy](https://github.com/pacdao/eu-action-1/blob/main/contracts/EUMinter.vy) implements custom minting logic.

Please note that the contract has not been through any audits or rigorous testing.  As the first of its type to be deployed, this remains a highly experimental implementation and users should consider this NFT extremely risky.  Neither PAC DAO nor Vyper assume any responsibility for loss of funds or collectibles from interacting with this NFT contract.
